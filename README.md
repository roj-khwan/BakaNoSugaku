# BakaNoSugaku
this project use genetic algorithm to solve some polynomial (I think?)
## what are you able to do
* you are able to customized the variable to get the difference out come
``` python
population_num = 4 # number of population per generation
num_range = range(0, 30) # possible gene
crossover_rate = 50 # rate to crossover
mutation_rate = 10 # rate to mutate
answer = 30 # the wanted outcome
coeffs = [1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1] # the coefficient of equation
```
* if you weren't familiar with code, please don't touch any thing other that that, or else it would be broken
## requirement
* python 3.11+
